# Password Generator
As employees with access to sensitive data, we needed a way to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that we can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## How it works
* Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a password.

* You will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria, including password character length, use of lowercase, uppercase letters, numeric values, and/ or special characters.

* Once user input prompt is complete a password will write to the textarea box with the "Your Secure Password" placeholder in the Generate a Password section of the page.

## Built-in safety
* Your inputs will be validated to ensure prevention of invalid inputs.

* If you are see the notification to "Try again!" click the "Generate Password" button to start over.

* When prompted to choose a length, you must enter at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

* When prompted to choose a character type, you must select at least one character type.
